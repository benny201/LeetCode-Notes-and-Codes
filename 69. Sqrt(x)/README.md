# Problem 
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x.


# My solution
     
* convert the problem to find the last position of n satisfy inputNumber >=  n * n;
* solve it by BinarySearch     

# A Btter solution
* subsitute the multiplication with division can advoid the overflow of int.


# Difficulties
* convert the int input to a long input to avoid overfolw


# Time complexity     
* O(logn)
