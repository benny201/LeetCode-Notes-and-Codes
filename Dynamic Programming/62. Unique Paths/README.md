# Problem 
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).


# My solution

* the same idea as the [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://github.com/benny201/LeetCode-Notes-and-Codes/tree/master/Dynamic%20Programming/64.%20Minimum%20Path%20Sum "64. Minimum Path Sum")

# Time complexity     
* O(n^2)
